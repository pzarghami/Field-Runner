# Field-Runner
this project is for the Advanced programming course
The purpose of this project is to learn about event-oriented object-oriented programming and use it along with graphic libraries.
Field Runners is a non-stop game from the tower defense category.
The game consists of a checkerboard where the enemies pass through a certain path on its houses. The player can build a tower in the houses on the game board that are not in the path of the enemies. Each tower needs some money to build and upgrade. At the beginning of each stage, the player has some money to build the initial towers. When the enemies start moving from the beginning of the path, the towers must destroy them before reaching the end of the path. Killing enemies increases the player's money.
